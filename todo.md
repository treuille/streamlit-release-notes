# Streamlit Release Note Apps

## Todo

- get the most recent version commit in develeop
  - add it to the list of tags in the thing
- get the list of commits in between the two tags
- given two versions, how can I figure out the pull requests that went into it
- parse those out
- eventually: go back into discuss and get that working
